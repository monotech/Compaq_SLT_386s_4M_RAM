# Compaq SLT 386s/20 4MiB RAM Module

Can be used alongside original modules.

The DRAM chips are obsolete and need to be purchased from the grey market.

The example part numbers below are just examples. There are many compatible chips from different brands with quite different part numbers. Compare datasheets.

Original modules used 80ns chips, so acquire chips that are 80ns or faster. I used 60ns just fine. Beware of fake/bad parts.

It's best to order with ENIG surface finish rather than HASL. If you'll be replugging it over a hundred times, selective 30u" hard-gold plating is recommended.
